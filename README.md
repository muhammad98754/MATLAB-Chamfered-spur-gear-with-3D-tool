# MATLAB-Chamfered-spur-gear-with-3D-tool
Built a 3D model of a Spur Gear in MATLAB and applied chamfering to the gear tooth, improving the durability and performance of the gear system

Initially, I developed a 2D gear single tooth and then applied chamfering to enhance its shape. Next, by utilizing a for loop ranging from 0 to 360 degrees, I successfully produced a 2D spur gear. To ensure flexibility and user-friendliness, I enabled the input parameters such as module, number of teeth, tooth thickness, and pitch radius to be adjustable by the user. Additionally, by using a 3D plot, I constructed a visually appealing 3D chamfered spur gear. It's worth mentioning that the manufacturing tool required to create this gear was quite simple as it involved attaching a small insert onto a hollow cylinder.
